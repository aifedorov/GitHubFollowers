# GitHubFollowers

Example take-home project job interview for my mentee or self-study.
I published the design on [Figma Community](https://figma.com/@aifedorov).

## Frameworks/Technologies
The project consists of two projects: `UIKit` and `SwiftUI` versions.
1) A GitHubFollowers iOS app written in `Swift` using `MVP` architectural pattern.
- [x] 100% programmatic UI using `UIKit` and `NSLayoutAnchor`.
- [x] No 3rd party libraries.
- [x] iOS 14.0 or higher.
- [x] Custom design for `UITabBar` and `UINavigationBar`.
- [x] `UITextField` with validation using `NSPredicate`.
- [x] `UICollectionView` and `UITableView` with `Diffable Data Source`.
- [x] `UISearchController` for searching users in the followers list.
- [x] `Swift Concurrency (async/await)` for the network.
- [x] Using `Codable` for encoding and decoding `JSON`.
- [x] Error handling and displaying user fullscreen or alert.
- [x] Caching image using `NSCache`.
- [ ] Caching favorites in `Core Data`.
- [ ] Supporting Pagination.
- [ ] Supporting Dark Mode.
- [ ] Supporting iPhone SE (fix collection view and add scroll view for Profile Screen)

1) A GitHubFollowers iOS app written using `SwiftUI` and `MVVM` architecture.
- [x] iOS 15.0 or higher.
- [x] No 3rd party libraries.
- [x] `Combine` Ð¸ `Swift Concurrency (async/await)`.
- [x] Caching image using `NSCache`.
- [x] Using `Codable` for encoding and decoding `JSON`.
- [ ] Error handling and displaying user alert.
- [ ] Caching favorites in `Core Data`.
- [ ] Supporting Pagination.
- [ ] Supporting Dark Mode.
- [ ] Unit tests.
- [ ] UI tests.

**Info:** Using `Core Data` for this project is overwhelming. Using a cache on a disk is enough. I use it for studying purposes.
